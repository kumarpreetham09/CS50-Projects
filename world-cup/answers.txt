Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations the timings were relatively close. However, as the number of simulations increased, the time taken increases rapidly

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 times of running the simulations
